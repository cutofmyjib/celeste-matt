          <p>His Story:</p>
          <p className='story-p'>
            I first saw Celeste while sitting in my manager’s office. He was telling me about the new
            hardware engineer that he had just hired and was showing me her resume; he also told me that
            she was quite a ‘firecracker’. I thought she was cute, I think her resume may have been
            impressive too..
            I remember meeting her for the first time at work in the hallway too. I knew it was her when she
            was ~100 feet away, she stands out in a room full of engineers. I think our first couple
            conversations were about her borrowing my XDS510 JTAG connector. I remember telling her
            where the gym was and inviting her to join the classes during lunch and talking about signing up
            for the dragon boat races and trying to get her to do the bravado challenge instead of the zombie
            run.
            We hadn’t hung out outside of work yet, but had talked about running,climbing, etc.. etc. I then
            finally ran into her at adventure rock. I remember walking into the gym behind her and thinking
            “sweet! I have a belayer today!”. We planned to climb together (on purpose) a couple of times
            and got sushi afterwards with her friends and did the UPAF ride together(ish). I was keeping it
            platonic at this point, since she was my coworker. I then spent a couple weeks in Shanghai for
            work. I remember only talking to a couple people while I was away and Celeste was one of them.
            We previously planned to go climbing and get brunch at first watch when I got back with a
            couple people, but only Celeste and I showed up! It was our first date; we got brunch, went
            climbing, and then got a massage. Later that night we went to see O.A.R. at summerfest. We had
            a great time, and since then, we’ve been together nearly every day!

          <p>Her Story:</p>
          <p className='story-p'>
            Where do I begin? Well I met Matt at Rockwell Automation in February of 2013 when I started working at my
            then new job. We both worked in the same department. One of the senior
            engineers took me around to meet everybody in the team when we stopped by his
            cubicle and did not happen to formally meet him. At first I thought, being a
            hardware engineer, "of course the firmware engineer wouldn't be in the office
            this early, (at 10in the morning methinks) young engineers these days!"
            Clearly I assumed he had no more than two years of experience. Little did I
            know know he only looked younger than his real age. The second time I met him
            was virtually through our team meeting when our manager introduced everyone's
            through their celebrity doppelgängers. His was Aaron Rodgers. It didn't occur
            to me why he'd think he looked like Aaron Rodgers. So again I bashing the
            firmware engineer, merely for his job label. I clearly didn't seem to care
            until I stumbled upon him at the rock climbing gym one night. I thought it was
            an awesome idea we had a mutual interest in climbing. I mean small world!
            Little did I know (again) that he'd been climbing for more than a decade. He
            eventually made his rockstar move, technically called a "dyno," which was
            pretty much the crux of whether I started to like the firmware guy. My eyes
            were glued on him. And two years later my heart.

            So how did he propose you might ask?! Apparently he had attempted to ask me
            once at the Rockwell Automation Clock Tower. He seemed a little odd that night
            like he was on to something, but it was hard to tell. It was an ordinary
            volleyball league night and no clues of something grand coming up. That fell
            through due to uncontrollable circumstances! Security couldn't let us through
            the tower for some unknown reasons. Anywho, so the actual day was a perfect
            fall October day at Devil's Lake State Park at our friend's birthday camping
            and Boulder rock climbing trip. The sun shined brightly and the fall leaves
            were at the peak of their perfectly amber and red shades. We went out
            bouldering and took photos of our hike up the mountain and the beautiful view
            of the lake. I may have suspected him being just a tad odd by strongly
            suggesting me to bring my nice "Super Asian Camera" but I could've never known
            what he was up to. Just suspicions! Twenty or so minutes into our walk, we
            finally reached the top of the mountain and took self-timed pictures. He had
            me stand and pose for the the camera while he set up the 10 second auto
            shutter. Just after he clicked the shutter he came running towards me, took
            out a box from his puffy jacket, and knelt down to ask me if I would marry
            him! To keep this story PG I shockingly responded with a loud profane word and
            then immediately said yes! Just to make sure I answered his question. And ever
            since I couldn't be any luckier than to meet the man who defied my
            presumptions, understood my dorkiest engineer jokes, and enabled me to wear
            the funkiest pants and plant the most colorful carrots (that I've never
            planted before I met him) I'm looking forward to doing more and greater more
            dorky things together!
